# Obsidian Reference Skill

This skill provides comprehensive technical references and standards for the Obsidian ecosystem.

## Purpose

To provide a central source of truth for API usage, file formats, and design standards.

## Scope

This skill covers:
- `manifest.json` requirements and validation
- Obsidian API details and documentation
- Obsidian-specific file formats (Markdown, Properties, Canvas)
- UI text conventions and UX patterns
- Mobile and platform compatibility

## Core Rules

- **API Authority**: The `obsidian.d.ts` file in the reference materials is the authoritative source for API details.
- **Terminology Consistency**: Follow the "properties" and "Markdown" naming conventions strictly.
- **Mobile First**: Consider mobile compatibility for all UI and file-handling features.

## Bundled Resources

- `references/manifest.md`: Detailed rules for `manifest.json`.
- `references/obsidian-file-formats.md`: Specifications for Markdown, Properties, and Canvas.
- `references/ux-copy.md`: UI text conventions and UX best practices.
- `references/references.md`: External links and primary source locations.
- `references/mobile.md`: Considerations for mobile compatibility.
- `references/performance.md`: Best practices for performance.
