## Note on Documentation Coverage

The official Obsidian developer documentation is maintained on a best-effort basis and may not cover every feature or API. For advanced or non-trivial features, developers sometimes:

- **Reference `app.css` directly** for undocumented CSS variables that exist in the app
- **Inspect `obsidian.d.ts`** for API methods not fully documented elsewhere
- **Look at popular plugins/themes** for patterns that work but aren't officially documented

Be aware that undocumented features may change between Obsidian versions without notice. When possible, prefer documented APIs and CSS variables for stability.
